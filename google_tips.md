# 1. Google Interview tips

Please review this [guide](http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/general_virtual_interviews_candidate_resource.pdf) for virtual interviewing tips and best practices

# 2. Theoretical material

* Data Structures & Algorithms including complexity analysis
  
  * Data structures: Lists, Stacks and Queues, Trees (BFS & DFS), Graphs, [Hash] sets and [Hash] maps, Heaps. 
  
  * Algorithms: Searching, Sorting (don’t do bubble-sort), Graphs, Big-O analysis, Dynamic programming.
  
  * Coding: choose one and stick to it, know it well (Java/C++/Python/C#), design (OOD if the question requires, readable code).

* “Extras” (may come up):
  
  * Math: Basic probability and statistics, Finite combinatorics, Binary operations (div, mod, xor..), “Back of the envelope” calculations
  
  * Operating Systems Concepts: Threads and processes, Synchronization

# 3. Practice

The information below holds everything you need to prepare for the interviews.
[Cracking the Code interview](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Cracking_the_Coding_Interview.html?id=anhAXwAACAAJ&hl=en)- we recommend working with this book and practicing at least 1-2 questions from each topic.

# 5. Interview Tips

* Allocate 45 minute slots to practice like an actual interview

* Think out loud about the questions you are asked - hearing how you think helps us better understand you

* Ask clarifying questions if you do not understand the problem or need more information

* Practice on Google Doc in your chosen language (real code!!)

* Test yourself (does it compile? work?)

* Learn from your mistakes & consider practicing with a friend (ask for feedback)
